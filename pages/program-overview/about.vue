            In its eighteenth year in existence, the KTM JUNIOR RACING Program

            Supercross heroes. While Junior Racing highlights these talented
            young riders from around the country and around the world, it also
            promotes riding and racing motorcycles as a family activity –
            exciting and accessible – especially for kids!
