            When accessing the website, various access data (e.g. IP address,
            date and time of access, name of opened file, etc.) are stored. No
            data evaluation which is specific to the individual is conducted.

            is generated by the web server with which you have established a
            connection through your web browser, and is then sent to you. The

            The default setting of most browsers is to automatically accept
            cookies. You can, however, reset your browser to decline such
            cookies or to have them fully displayed including the necessary
            requirements for consent. You can also delete cookies from your
            system at any time. The collection and storage occurs exclusively in
            an anonymous or pseudonymous form and does not allow any information
            to be inferred about you as an individual person.

          <h2>5. Storage and protection of personal data</h2>
          <p>
            We have taken a number of measures to guarantee the security of your
            personal data when you enter or place an order, or access your
            personal information. We adopt appropriate data collection, storage
            and processing practices and security measures for protection
            against unauthorized access, changes, transfer or destruction of
            personal data, user names, passwords, transactions, information and
            other data stored on our website. These processes can be maintained
            by our suppliers. The transfer of this data can involve the
            processing and completion of orders on our website, as well as
            provision of support services. We take all appropriate measures to
            ensure that personal data is handled securely and according to our
            data protection guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The information is protected by a combination of physical and
            technical measures in a secure environment. There is no public
            access to this information. All information provided can only be
            accessed by specially authorized persons with access rights to our
            system who are obliged to handle the information strictly
            confidentially. Beyond this, national legislation could compel us to
            store information for a certain period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personal information collected on KTM websites is stored in a secure
            operating environment that is not publicly accessible. Sometimes the
            personal data is additionally encrypted with suitable security
            systems prior to the transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sensitive and private data exchange between KTM websites and
            visitors occurs through SSL secured communication channels, is
            encrypted and provided with digital signatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            KTM conducts business in many countries of the world. To be able to
            offer our customers uniform services, regardless of their location,
            we maintain our home pages and websites around the world. When you
            transfer personal information to KTM, you agree that this
            information may be transmitted across national borders and be stored
            and processed in each of the countries in which KTM and its
            affiliated companies have offices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Internet is by no means secure. You should therefore be careful
            of the information you disclose when you are online. We cannot
            guarantee the security of information that we have gathered
            electronically or by other means, though we do however take all
            necessary steps to provide the best possible security. Visitors thus
            transfer information to us at their own risk.
          </p>
          <h2>6. Disclosure of personal data</h2>
          <p>
            All of the personal data collected by KTM is obtained in accordance
            with the applicable data protection regulations in each case and
            used for the purpose of fulfilling contracts/orders and processing
            your requests. Disclosure of your data to third parties without your
            express permission does not occur, provided it is not required in
            order to provide services or to fulfill contractual obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also take in-house data protection very seriously. Our employees
            and subcontracted service companies are obliged by us to maintain
            confidentiality and to adhere to data protection regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In cases where we bring in an external service provider, we have
            also ensured that this provider was chosen and checked in accordance
            with the relevant legal regulations and is likewise committed to
            observing data protection regulations and laws. Apart from this, no
            disclosure of your data is made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your data is not sold, leased or otherwise transmitted to external
            third parties. This does not include: Trustworthy partners, who
            support us in operating the website or who provide assistance within
            the scope of doing business or other services, while of course it is
            also ensured that they are also obliged to maintain confidentiality.
          </p>
          <p>
            A disclosure to the affiliated companies of KTM or other third
            parties only occurs to the extent these recipients of the
            information have committed themselves to KTM in regard to the
            applicable data protection regulations. Within the scope of
            processing your order or request we sometimes commission external
            service providers, who are however in any event contractually
            obligated to comply with data protection regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The respective KTM distribution subsidiary works together with
            trustworthy partners.

            In such cases, we will delete or block your data to prevent further
            processing and use. Insofar as such a deletion is against the legal
            provisions for data storage, or if the deletion is linked to
            disproportionately high costs, we will block such data from further

            10. KTM&#39;s commitment to protecting the privacy of children
          </h2>
          <p>
            The protection of children&#39;s data is important to us. For this
            reason, we do not collect or maintain any data of children who are,
            to our knowledge, under 14 years of age without first obtaining the
            verifiable consent of the parents or guardian with parental
            authority. In addition, we require only so much personal information
            from children as is absolutely necessary for their participation in
            activities. On request, those with parental authority can view the
            data stored for their child or have it deleted.
